# chrome-tmp-cleaner
## What is it  
this is a cleaner script. It is designed to clean chrome artifacts on Windows Server after your chrome was killed by autotest flow or failed to clean it's temporal folder upon proper exit procedures.
It was made long ago for scoped_dir issue solution. I decided to keep it in case the issue is reintroduced in the future. 

## How to use  
1. read ps1 file because nobody but you is responsible for concequences.
2. edit path to Cleaner in run.bat
3. execute run.bat
